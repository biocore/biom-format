# RBIOM

This is an R package for interfacing with the [biom format](http://biom-format.org/).

Some more details:

 * Feature requests for this package should go in the [official Issues list for biom-format](https://github.com/biom-format/biom-format/issues)

 * Use [roxygen2](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen) for building documentation of the RBIOM package

 * Plan to release RBIOM as an official package in [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/), once it is ready.
