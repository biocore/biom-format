# R-code

This upper level R-code directory is a place for R examples and R support scripts for the other biom tools. The R package for interfacing with the biom format is contained within another level lower, called "rbiom".

Some more details:

 * To-Dos belong in [the official biom-format issues tracker](https://github.com/biom-format/biom-format/issues) on GitHub.

 * Use roxygen2 for building documentation of the rbiom package

 * Plan to release rbiom in CRAN, once it is ready.
