# R-code

This upper level R-code directory is a place for R examples and R support scripts for the other biom tools. The R package for interfacing with the biom format is contained within another level lower, called "rbiom".

Some more details:

 * Should add To-Dos in the official Issues list for biom-format

 * Use roxygen2 for building documentation of the rbiom package

 * Plan to release rbiom in Bioconductor, once it is ready.
