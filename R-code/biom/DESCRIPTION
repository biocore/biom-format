Description: This is an R package for interfacing with the
    BIOM format. Currently in beta form, this package
    includes basic tools for reading biom-format files,
    accessing and subsetting data tables from a biom object
    (which is more complex than a single table), as well as
    limited support for writing a biom-object back to a
    biom-format file. The design of this API is intended to
    match the python API and other tools included with the
    biom-format project, but with a decidedly "R flavor"
    that should be familiar to R users. This includes S4
    classes and methods, as well as extensions of common
    core functions/methods.
