===============================================

[![biom-format CI](https://github.com/biocore/biom-format/actions/workflows/python-package-conda.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/biocore/biom-format/actions/workflows/python-package-conda.yml)

The BIOM file format (canonically pronounced *biome*) is designed to be a general-use format for representing counts of observations (e.g., OTUs, KO categories, lipid types) in one or more biological samples (e.g., microbiome samples, genomes, metagenomes).
